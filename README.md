# GenderRecognition
Different voice samples have different set of acoustic properties. Although these properties differ even within the samples of same gender,it is the range and pattern of differences among these properties that can be used to determine the gender of speaker. We have extracted and stored audio features using the tools and functions provided by warbler and seewave library in R. Further using computed acoustic characteristics to predict gender, we applied following models to our dataset : 1. Classification &amp; Regression tree  (CART) 2. Random forest 3. SVM 4. Neural Network  5. Ensembled Models
